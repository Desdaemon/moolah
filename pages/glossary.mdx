Volume
Volume signifies the amount of shares traded, indicating market strength. Generally, rising markets on increasing volume are 
seen as strong and healthy, whereas, prices falling on increasing volume is seen as it is gathering strength to the downside. High volume stocks
are usually at a trade volume of 500,000 or more a day, with low trade volume being below that.

High & Low
High is the highest price at which a stock is traded during a period. Low is the lowest price at which a stock is traded during a period.
It is also common to see a stock's 52-week high and 52-week low listed, giving us the daily high and low close for over a year. This
provides an idea of a stock's trading range annually.

Close
Closing prices refer to the price of an individual stock when the stock exchange closed shop for the day. This proves to be significant as it,
determines how a stock performed throughout a trading day. It is agreed upon as the deciding factor for how a stock has changed on a daily basis,
allowing previous closing day prices across days, months, and years to be tracked.

Open
Openning prices mean the price at which a stock is traded at the beginning of a trading day. Sometimes, this can be the same as the stock's
closing price as the previous day, however, it can be changed if a company's earning reports are revealed in after-hours of a trading day.
